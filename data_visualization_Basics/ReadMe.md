# Data Visualization

* The transition from cognition to perception.

* Helps to have a more Human Friendly Information Processing and Analysis via Charts, Graphs etc.

* Not suitable in situation where automation is already present.

* Suitable and Intended as a Tool that helps human to have a clear , detailed or concise (depending on the situation) view of the Information/Raw Data.

# Using D3 and React Vs Python , Power BI

* Power BI , python and R such type of tools/languages have a lot of Abstraction which restricts a Developer or User to actually understand what is behind the curtains.

* A data visualization tool developed from scratch is more flexible and Customizable than a Highly Abstract Power BI or Python or R tool.

* React is the most widely used Industry level liberary for UI/UX and many other usecases .

# React Core Advantages

* Component Model

* State management

# Finding Visualization Ideas , Types , Samples on the WEB.

* Reuters Graphics

* The upshot

* The pudding

* FiveThirtyEight (rear samples Unique)

* FlowingDATA

* Reddit :Data is baeutifull

* kantar:information is beautiffull (good design samples)

* Quartz (Awesome large scale samples)

* graphic detail (Information dense visualization like satellite launch)

* Dataviz

* blockbuilder search (lot of samples of data visualization with examples on different technique)

* observable (trending ,most liked data visualization pieces)

# Why Use Web Technologies (html,css,javascript,svg)

* Accessible to anyone with a Web Browser.

* No need to install anything locally

* Advanced frontend engineering approaches.

* Custom design work possible

* Adding Interactivity on large scale.


# SVG Scalable Vector Graphics (to add graphics to websites)

* Raster Vs Vector (svg no problem of pixelation)

* Raster- image comprise of pixels .jpeg .png .gif
svg- Image is defined in terms of the shapes and paths .svg

* Raster has better performance than .SVG
but svg have more scaling aspect than Raster.

* svg do not get blurred while zoom unlike Raster images

# D3

* Data driven Documents

* javascript liberary for processing dynamic interactive data visualization in the web browser.

* tons of utility function.

# D3 and React

* React helps to make complex interactive systems that is not possible with D3 alone.

# Difference in CDN and NPM install

#### We usually use npm when working with node.js backend server side.
#### For client side i.e browser side Data Visualizion projects we can Use CDN's

### Content Distribution Network(CDN)

- Efficient way to getting the files to the browser.
- Instead of only single server like npm hosting all packages in CDN multiple server can provide the CDN for the requirements by just including the script tag and passing the CDN url.

## UNPKG

- Is an open source content delivery network for everything on npm use it to load any package by just the url.

- ****unpkg.com/:package@:version/:file****

- you just have to specify package version and file.

## rollup.js

- Roll up is module bundler basically combines bunch of javascript modules it understands latest JSX.
